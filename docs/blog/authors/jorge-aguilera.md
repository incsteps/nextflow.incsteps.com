Senior Software Engineer | Nextflow Core Developer | Open Source Advocate With 30 years of experience in the software industry, I have spent the last 6 years focused on the Nextflow core and developing its plugin ecosystem. 

I am a firm believer in the power of Open Source and dedicated to sharing my knowledge with the community. My current work bridges the gap between high-performance data pipelines and secure, private infrastructure—leveraging tools like Tailscale and Kubernetes to build resilient, distributed systems.
